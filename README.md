# Applied ZKP Workshop

This is a workshop focus on ZK Applications (a.k.a. Applied ZKP). Upon finishing this workshop, you should:
* understand the basic concept of ZKP
* know how to write a (maybe simple-ish) circuit in Circom
* know about basic security principles of writing circuits
* understand how to architect and deploy a zkDApp (on Ethereum or Ethereum L2)

## Prerequisites 

* Install [Circom 2.0](https://docs.circom.io/getting-started/installation/)
* [things to know before start](https://learn.0xparc.org/materials/circom/prereq-materials/prereq-understanding/)
